###Question 1: The intercept coefficient and the vehicle_length and ground_clearance variables all appear to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mg values in the dataset.
###Question 2: Given a p-value of roughly .00, I reject the null hypothesis which states the slope is equal to zero; thereby, accepting the alternative hypothesis which states that the slope is not equal to zero. 
###Question 3: The adjusted r-squared statistic of .68 indicates that the linear model effectively predicts the mpg with moderate strength.
